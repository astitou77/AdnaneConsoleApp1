# DOM > WebDriver[user_agent] > Selenium[] > Web Browser
This Project aims to explore the use of <b>WebDriver</b> by the Testing Framework <b>SELENIUM</b> and how it is able to discover and manipulate <b>DOM</b> elements with <b>user agents</b> to remotely control the <b>Web Browsers</b> instance.

<h2>WebDriver</h2>

A Language-neutral (Python, C#, Java...etC) wire Protocol for out-of-process programs (ex.: Selenium framework) to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers (ex.: Chrome, Firefox, Edge...etc)

It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write <b>TESTS</b> that automate a user agent from a separate controlling process (Ex.: Selenium application) 

Provided is a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements in (HTML) web documents and to control the behavior of a user agent
